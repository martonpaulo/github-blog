**GitHub Blog** is a personal blog application that leverages GitHub's API to display a user's profile and blog posts. The posts are managed as GitHub issues, meaning the title is the post's title and the issue content is the post body.

The app fetches data from GitHub's Users, Issues, and Search APIs, displays a summary of each post, and uses dynamic routing to show full posts. It converts markdown content from GitHub into HTML for proper display, offering an engaging and integrated experience.
